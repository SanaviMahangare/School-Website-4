  The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online Minas with photographs of the means prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a school canteen account on the School website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and  paying for meals online can eliminate all the the fuss of money  handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

    1. Accuracy 
    Humans are prone to errors, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimise the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.   </p>
  <br>
  2.Economics 
Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and over payment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium  group found that large organisations save up to $1600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management  systems. 
<br>
3.Productivity / Efficiency 
Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorise leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up aprecious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimising the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improve profits. And many more like visibility / insights, hazel free workflow management, flexibility, integration / configuration, real time tracking, security and compliance.
